ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Toby. I'm a tech obsessed nerd who specializes in web development, AI development, app development and IT security.

The main languges I use are Python, Go, CSS, HTML, Javascript and Swift.

And yes, basically all of my repositories are private.

I am currently building a personal portfolio that should be done in a few days! 

Have a nice day- Toby :)
