******ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Toby!******

 I'm a tech obsessed nerd who specializes in web development, but also understands app development, AI development and IT security.

The main languges I use are  CSS, HTML, Javascript, Go, Python and Swift.

I use macOS, Windows and occasionally Linux. My preference for development is macOS though.

And yes, basically all of my repositories are private.

If you would like to get in contact with me, please don't hesitate to send me an email here; toby@tobyb.xyz!

Have a nice day! - Toby :)
