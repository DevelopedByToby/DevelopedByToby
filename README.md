ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Toby, a tech obsessed nerd who specializes in web development, but also understands app development, AI development and IT security.

The main languges I use are  CSS, HTML, Javascript, Go, Python and Swift.

I use macOS, Windows and Linux occasionally. My preference for development is macOS though.

And yes, basically all of my repositories are private.

Have a nice day- Toby :)
