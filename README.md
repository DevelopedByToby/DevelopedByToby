******👋 Hi! I’m Toby!******

I'm a tech obsessed nerd who specializes in web development, but also understands app development, AI development and IT security.

The main languges I use are  CSS, HTML, Javascript, Go, Python and Swift.

I use macOS, Windows and occasionally Linux. My preference for development is macOS though.

And yes, basically all of my repositories are private.

Right now, I'm:
- Working on my personal website 👨🏻‍💻
- Developing a home assistant 🖥
- Trying to start a company 📈
- Doing schoolwork 🎓

If you would like to get in contact with me, please don't hesitate to send me an email here; toby@tobyb.xyz!

Have a nice day! - Toby :)
