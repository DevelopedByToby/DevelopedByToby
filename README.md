  Hi! I’m Toby! 👋
</h1>

I'm a 12 year old tech obsessed nerd from England who specializes in web development, but also understands app development (mainly iOS), AI development and IT security.

The main languages I use are;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Go</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a>.

I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">MacOS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows"> Windows</a> and occasionally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>. My preference for development is macOS though.

And yes, basically all of my repositories are private.

Right now, I'm:
- Working on my personal website 👨🏻‍💻
- Developing a home assistant 🏡
- Trying to start a company 📈
- Doing schoolwork 🎓
- Listening to cringey music 🎼
