  Hi! I'm Toby! 👋
</h1>

I'm a 12 year old tech obsessed nerd from England, and member of Hack Club who specializes in web development, but also understands app development (mainly iOS), AI development and IT security.

The main languages I use are;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Go</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a>.

I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">MacOS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows"> Windows</a> and occasionally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>. But, my preference for development is macOS though.

By the way! My pronouns are <b>he/him</b>, but I am also happy for people to refer to me as <b>they/them</b>
